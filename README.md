# Recon

A starter project for heterogeneous asset tasking and event correlation. This repository
contains the initial folder structure for a backend API, a future frontend
dashboard, and documentation.

## Repository Structure

- `backend/` – Placeholder for the API implementation.
- `frontend/` – Placeholder for a map and tasking dashboard.
- `docs/` – Project documentation and API examples.

See [`docs/api_endpoints.md`](docs/api_endpoints.md) for example requests to the
currently supported endpoints.

Additional directories and code will be added as the project evolves.
